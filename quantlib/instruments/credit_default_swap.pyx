        Parameters
        ----------
        side : int or {BUYER, SELLER}
           Whether the protection is bought or sold.
        notional : float
            Notional value
        spread  : float
            Running spread in fractional units.
        schedule : :class:`~quantlib.time.schedule.Schedule`
            Coupon schedule.
        paymentConvention : int
            Business-day convention for
            payment-date adjustment.
        dayCounter : :class:`~quantlib.time.daycounter.DayCounter`
            Day-count convention for accrual.
        settlesAccrual : bool, optional
            Whether or not the accrued coupon is
            due in the event of a default.
        paysAtDefaultTime : bool, optional
            If set to True, any payments
            triggered by a default event are
            due at default time. If set to
            False, they are due at the end of
            the accrual period.
        protectionStart : :class:`~quantlib.time.date.Date`, optional
            The first date where a default
            event will trigger the contract.

        Notes
        -----
        This instrument currently assumes that the issuer did
        not default until today's date.

        .. warning::

            if ``Settings.include_reference_date_cashflows``
            is set to ``True``, payments occurring at the
            settlement date of the swap might be included in the
            NPV and therefore affect the fair-spread
            calculation. This might not be what you want.
